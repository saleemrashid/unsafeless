# unsafeless

Transmuting types in Go without using `unsafe` or `reflect`. See [unsafeless.go](unsafeless.go) for an explanation
and [unsafeless\_test.go](unsafeless_test.go) for example usage.

This concept doesn't actually need Go 1.18, but the generics make it easier to use? Maybe? It might be even nicer if
type inference worked properly.
